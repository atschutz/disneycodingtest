# android-sdk-coding-exercise
Take-home coding exercise for candidates applying for development positions

This is not a fully-functional project, but imagine receiving this work as a task to complete. Review and make changes that you think should happen to clean up the codebase, make functional, and demonstrate a maintainable project.

## Some things to consider

Try not to put too much time into this project (on average about a couple hours) - consider documenting what you would do if more time was allocated. Question what you notice and we can review during our interview.

Use a git branch to complete the work so we can talk through the journey.

Things to look out for:
- Improvements to the architecture, naming, and readability.
- Dependency injection.
- Thread safety.
- Testing. 
- Error reporting / handling.
- Applicability of other concurrency solutions such as coroutines.
- Performance for concurrent API invocations from multiple threads.
